# Flask Contact Form with Email Notification

This project is a simple Flask web application that includes a contact form. Upon form submission, the server sends the form data (name, email, and message) as an email to the provided email address using Flask-Mail.

## Features

- A basic contact form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
- Form submissions are sent as email notifications to the recipient email address.
- Flask-Mail is used to send emails through Gmail's SMTP server.

## Requirements

Make sure to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-Mail

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install flask flask-mail
```

## Setting up Gmail for Flask-Mail

To send emails using Gmail's SMTP server, you need to configure your Gmail account:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** on your Gmail account if not already enabled.
2. **Generate an App Password** by visiting [Google's App Password page](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
3. Use the generated App Password instead of your regular Gmail password in the `MAIL_PASSWORD` configuration.

> **Important**: Never commit your actual Gmail password in the code. Always use an app password for added security.

## Configuration

In the `app.py` file, configure the following settings:

- `MAIL_SERVER`: The email server you're using (e.g., for Gmail, use `smtp.gmail.com`).
- `MAIL_PORT`: The port used for sending emails (use `587` for TLS).
- `MAIL_USERNAME`: Your Gmail email address.
- `MAIL_PASSWORD`: The App Password generated for your Gmail account.
- `MAIL_USE_TLS`: Set this to `True` for Gmail's TLS connection.
- `MAIL_USE_SSL`: Set this to `False` for Gmail, as it uses TLS rather than SSL.

## Running the Application

Once you have configured the application, you can run the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server on your local machine. You can access the contact form by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

```

## Troubleshooting

- If you face issues sending emails, check your Gmail account's security settings to ensure access for less secure apps is allowed or you are using an app password.
- Ensure all required Python libraries are installed by running `pip install flask flask-mail`.
- Verify that the email settings in the `app.py` file are correct.
- If Gmail blocks the sign-in attempt, try reviewing the security alerts in your Gmail account.
